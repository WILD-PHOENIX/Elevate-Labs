# Task 2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective:
To understand and analyze the dataset using statistics and visualizations

Tools & Libraries Used:
 Pandas
 Matplotlib
 Seaborn
 Plotly

Dataset Used:
[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https//wwwkagglecom/datasets/yasserh/titanicdataset)

What I Did:
1 Generated **summary statistics** (mean median standard deviation etc)
2 Created **histograms boxplots and countplots** to understand data distribution
3 Built **pairplots and heatmaps** to examine relationships and correlations
4 Identified **outliers and skewness** in the data
5 Noted down trends and patterns helpful for feature engineering

Key Learnings:
 How to interpret plots like histograms boxplots and heatmaps
 What correlation tells us about feature relationships
 Importance of visualization in identifying data issues or insights
 How EDA supports better model development

Output:
All visualizations and outputs are available in the uploaded Colab notebook [`Task_2ipynb`](/Task_2ipynb)
