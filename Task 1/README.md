Title-Titanic Dataset Data Cleaning and Preparation for ML

I. Project Overview
This project illustrates data cleaning and preparation methods with the Titanic dataset. We'll deal with missing values, encode categorical features, normalize numerical data, and drop outliers.
Dataset

II. Source: Titanic Dataset (/content/Titanic-Dataset.csv)

III. Objective: Clean and prepare data for machine learning

IV. Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

V. Steps Performed
1. Data Exploration
Loaded dataset and viewed basic structure
Checked types, shape, and missing values
Computed descriptive statistics

2. Missing Value Analysis
Identified columns with missing values
Visualized patterns of missing values
Implemented suitable imputation techniques

3. Data Cleaning
Managed missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
Removed or imputed according to data distribution and business rules

4. Feature Engineering
Translated categorical variables to numbers using encoding methods
Derived new features from existing features (e.g., family size)
Dropped unnecessary features

5. Data Normalization
Normalized numerical features using StandardScaler
Made all features comparable on similar scales

6. Outlier Detection and Removal
Applied boxplots and IQR technique to find outliers
Deleted extreme outliers that may impact model performance

7. Data Visualization
Developed visualizations for data distribution understanding
Produced correlation heatmaps
Plotted before/after cleaning comparisons

VI. Key Learnings
Data Quality Assessment: Learning the relevance of data exploration prior to cleaning
Missing Value Strategies: Varying strategies for varying missing data types
Feature Encoding: Converting categorical features for ML algorithms
Scaling Techniques: Feature normalization relevance
Outlier Management: Finding balance between data quality and information preservation

VII. Files Generated
Cleaned data ready to use for ML
Visualization plots indicating data distribution
Statistical summaries pre and post cleaning
