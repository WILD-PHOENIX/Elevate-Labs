# Tree-Based Models for Heart Disease Classification

A comprehensive analysis of Decision Trees and Random Forest classifiers for predicting heart disease using machine learning.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements and compares tree-based machine learning models to classify heart disease patients. The analysis includes overfitting detection, feature importance ranking, and model optimization.

## 🛠️ Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download the heart disease dataset** (CSV format)
2. **Update the file path** in the notebook:
   ```python
   CSV_FILE_PATH = "path/to/your/heart_disease_dataset.csv"
   ```
3. **Run all cells** in the Jupyter notebook

## 📊 What's Included

- **Decision Tree Classifier** with visualization
- **Overfitting Analysis** across different tree depths
- **Random Forest Implementation** with hyperparameter tuning
- **Feature Importance Comparison** between models
- **Cross-Validation Evaluation** for model stability
- **Performance Metrics** including confusion matrices

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Automatic CSV loading and preprocessing
- ✅ Interactive visualizations and plots
- ✅ Comprehensive model comparison
- ✅ Grid search for optimal parameters
- ✅ Feature importance analysis

## 📈 Results

The analysis provides insights into:
- Which features are most important for heart disease prediction
- How tree depth affects overfitting
- Performance comparison between single trees vs ensemble methods
- Model stability through cross-validation

## 🔧 Usage

Simply open the `.ipynb` file in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells after updating your dataset path.
