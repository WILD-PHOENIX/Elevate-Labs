# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to perform **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis**, and **build a linear regression model** to predict housing prices. The dataset used is `Housing.csv`, which includes various attributes such as number of bedrooms, presence of air conditioning, and area.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `t3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, visualization, and model implementation.
- `Housing.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 📊 Features Used

The dataset includes features such as:
- Area (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Presence of amenities like:
  - Main road access
  - Guest room
  - Basement
  - Hot water heating
  - Air conditioning
- Parking availability
- Number of stories
- Furnishing status

## ⚙️ Techniques Applied

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Splitting Dataset into Training and Testing
- Building a **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** Model
- Evaluating model performance using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
